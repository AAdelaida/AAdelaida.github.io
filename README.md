### Interactive Map of Museums in Mexico City
This project uses Geopandas and Folium to generate an interactive map with markers of the main museums in Mexico City, which you can consult by town hall. In addition, through pop-up windows the names, images and websites of the museums are displayed.

- I used Geocoding to converting museums' name into geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude).
- I used a GeoDataFrame to store the museums information.
- I create a map centered on Mexico City, adds markers for the principal museums of Mexico City and pop-up displaying the museum names, images, and websites.To improve the readability and usability of the map, I add a menu bar to display museums by town hall. 

You can select Town Hall:
